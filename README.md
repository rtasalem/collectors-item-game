# Collector's Item: A Text-based Murder Mystery Game ðŸ”ªðŸ©¸
### Acknowledgements
Credit and thanks to [RyiSnow on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow) for their tutorial on [_How to Make a Text Adventure Game with GUI in Java_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUMB0xEMZosWbyQo_Kil0Fb). This tutorial was used as the main reference for building _Collector's Item_.
## Background
This is the first game I ever made: a simple text-based murdery mystery.  
**Synopsis:**
You are D.S. Thomas Doyle. After arriving home late one night, your phone begins to ring.
Multiple homicides, all having taken place within the last 2 hours, all with the same M.O.
As D.S., you must attend each crime scene and search for clues that might expose the killer.
You are constantly faced with different choices, which shape how the killer is revealed.
Will the truth come out?
## Libraries & Technologies
- This project utilises the Swing library (javax.swing) to make use of GUI (graphical user interface) components including JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JButton, and JTextArea.
## Learning Milestones
From this project I learned how to use GUI components in Java to create a text-based game. A core feature of the game is that the player is presented with multiple choices and small changes in the game's progression are dependant on these choices. There are also two different endings that a player can achieve while playing the game.
## Getting Started
After cloning the repository, run the Game.java file to begin playing _Collector's Item_.
