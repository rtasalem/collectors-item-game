## About the Game\
You are D.S. Thomas Doyle. After arriving home late one night, your phone begins to ring. \
Multiple homicides, all having taken place within the last 2 hours, all with the same M.O. \
As D.S., you must attend each crime scene and search for clues that might expose the killer.\
You are constantly faced with different choices, which shape how the killer is revealed.\
Will the truth come out?\
