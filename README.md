### Acknowledgements
Credit and thanks to [RyiSnow on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow) for their tutorial on [_How to Make a Text Adventure Game with GUI in Java_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUMB0xEMZosWbyQo_Kil0Fb). This tutorial was used as the main reference for building _Collector's Item_.
## Background
This is the first game I ever made. 
## About the Game
You are D.S. Thomas Doyle. After arriving home late one night, your phone begins to ring.
Multiple homicides, all having taken place within the last 2 hours, all with the same M.O.
As D.S., you must attend each crime scene and search for clues that might expose the killer.
You are constantly faced with different choices, which shape how the killer is revealed.
Will the truth come out?
## Libraries
This project utilises the Swing library (javax.swing) to make use of the following GUI (graphical user interface) components: JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JButton, and JTextArea.
## Getting Started
After cloning the repository, simply run the Game.java file to begin playing the game.
